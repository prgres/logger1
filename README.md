## Overview

Logger1, the little logger that could, started its journey as a sidekick for another project. However, it soon became evident that it was missing a few pieces of the interface puzzle, causing some mild chaos. As life got complicated, Logger1 fell behind the times, feeling unloved and incomplete.

## The Charm Log Savior

Enter Charm Log, our hero with a cape and a solution! Charm Log not only added features but also brought compatibility with std log and slog/log. It turns out that Logger1's initial ambitions weren't necessary anymore.

## Why This Project?

The primary goal of this project is to provide a standard interface for passing logs between libraries. Think of it as a peace ambassador for logs, bridging the gaps and making sure everyone speaks the same language. However, Logger1 needs a bit of tender loving care to fulfill its destiny.

## Contribution and Hugs Welcome

If you have a soft spot for logs and want to make Logger1 the happiest logger in the world, contributions are more than welcome! Together, we can turn Logger1 into the log of your dreams â€“ reliable, complete, and ready to spread joy throughout your codebase.
